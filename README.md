# nomad-rank-cities

I want you build a web application that ranks cities based on how friendly they might be for digital nomads.  Make the web app mobile friendly.  Use a clean design. 

### Navbar
With name of app (NomadRank) 

### Hero
Explain the value prop of this app clearly, add a background image showing tropical destination

### Searcheable list of cities
List 5 placeholder cities. Each city should have a card that shows the name of the city, the country, the rank.
